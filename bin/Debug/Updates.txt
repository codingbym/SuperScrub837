Version 1.0.0.12
-Fixed validation bug - 2000B HL absence was not being caught when 2000C segment is in the same overall segment
--------------------------
Version 1.0.0.11
-Fixed bug that prevents analysis of the file when there is only one CLM/claim segment
-Change of legal notice in the About window
-Additional fix for when there are multiple HI segments in a given claim object - exception will throw for possible forseeable edge cases. Will address separately if that comes up.
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.10
-Fixed bug that caused the file to not process when only one subscriber was found in the segment (usually during 2000B breaks)
-Addressed somewhat related bug during 2000B breaking where the first segment broken off from the HL 22 is an SBR segment
-Different error message throws when there are HL elements in the footer - this usually indicates something that went wrong during batching of the file, often resulting in multiple/sometimes incomplete footer segments
-In addition to error throwing above, program will try to break off the last footer in case that ends the file properly
-Small cosmetic bug - contact form is now blanked after message is sent to the dev
-Fixed small but annoying bug that didn't allow you to copy the PCN number from the Claim/FIN number cell in grid view
-Fixed other cosmetic defect - error count will show when the window is NOT a view of the file after being broken down properly into segments
-Finally have the progress bar showing the progress of an update in subsequent updates now! W00t! Application WILL still restart after the update finishes, closing the older window
-Fix added for when duplicate LX segments have been found in loading the out of order LX error's line number
-Finally, added new robustness feature - sometimes CLM segments will pop up in the middle of another HL improperly. These are broken off into segments, with a warning to check PCM preferences or the interface that batched the file. Other thing to note, one may try to check the claim in Revenue Cycle to see if the HL/SBR segments are missing from that claim...
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.9
-Claim/FIN numbers now filter when you search for them in the search field of the popup menu instead of merely scrolling to the claim number
-You can now drag the claim/FIN filter popup and error filter popup around
-Contact form fixed - different method is used to send feedback now, no email address required
-About window will now focus/appear even though it was minimized when you click Options->About
-Splash screen is no longer the top screen, so you will not be confused when it auto loads the "Cerner" disclaimer
-Fixed another segment loading bug concerning loading other subscribers.
-Search for 2400 SV2 will no longer cause the application to crash when the entire segment is missing (previously was assuming the line was present when searching for revenue codes)
-Fixed bug for when LX segments are out of order - the LX segment was not being searched for to help match up the line number of the LX error found
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.8
-You can now choose to either copy and paste the claim numbers/errors in the usual grid form or select the text inside. Hit the "Text Selection" checkbox to switch between grid and textline functionality
-You can now filter the claims OR errors (same icon to filter)
-Fixed both filter popups so that the scrollbar will appear when there is an excessive amount of items
-You can now scroll to a claim/FIN in the claim filter popup to save yourself time scrolling for it
-You can now sort the errors so that they come to the top for you to see, the same way you can sort PCN number/claim segments
-You can see the number of errors that were found in the file
-Added a "Contact" form in the "About" window. Use it to give your feedback on this application, or even ask specific questions!
-Total error count in the bottom right window
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.7
-LOTS of changes! Loading the program goes straight to blank window instead of file explorer. Splash screen also doesn't hang until you click, it disappears now!
-You will now be notified of the next update when loading your program instead of having to click "Update"
-Added a progress bar for the update progress - keeps users from thinking the program is freezing when it's downloading the next update for the app
-Upon your next update, the previous version window WILL automatically close
-These updates are now ordered latest at top to earliest at bottom
-This window has been modified to make better use of the space, especially for these patch notes. You can copy these and paste elsewhere, too!
-You can't have multiple windows of this "About" screen open anymore.
-You can now narrow down claim files when opening a file to a limited degree, mainly by 837i/837p/837r/Other
-Breaking preference fixed to reflect the one that was selected when one manually breaks the segments
-2000C breaking has been taken away for now, will probably return as an optional checkbox (not every subscriber will have a patient segment)
-You now have a line number of a given offending number. The newer field checks are going to have a precise line number, while missing segments may sometimes have an approximate line number where you'd find them
-Extra "No Claim Segment" row removed
-Space between middle data grid and header windows slightly adjusted
-You can now search for a claim number to bring up the row in your window if you want to simply find a corresponding claim segment with a PCN. You can also search for a line number of a claim segment and pull those up
-You can sort by claim and line numbers, too. NOTE: When sorting by line numbers, it may not appear to work the other way due to the way the line numbers are divided between claim segments right now, but it is, trust me
-Revised "HL Segment Integrity Failure" window to be more clear on CLM to HL comparison issues (hint: manual break USUALLY does wonders)
-The claim segments and their line numbers are list item boxes now. You can choose a number of them and paste them over.
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.6
-Added more flexibility with window view, can now maximize/resize screen
-Added line numbers for the concerned 837 segments to help compare lines with open file in apps like Notepad++
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.5
-Added 2300 HI checks - qualifies multiple offending lines, though currently only the first HI code in the segment
-Also added 2300 DTP checks - currently field checks for identifier only
-Added DTP and REF checks to line items for identifier code
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.4
-Fixed another bug where subscribers do not break down properly - also fixed bug that can occur when validating the CLM segment
-Fixed/improved line item check. Now will be able to 'error' without system error, and should error when line item index is out
of order
-Now adding check for missing revenue codes (only if it's a UB claim file)
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.3
-Fixed a critical bug. Did not split out line items as expected. See the GitHub Repo if you wish to see revision details
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.2
-Can now identify the type of batch file (837I, 837P, State Report)
-Included 2300 and 2400 provider/service facility checks
-Application didn't restart properly when updating last - this SHOULD fix it...
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.1
-Fix to allow more delimiters than the asterisk in batch files
-Fix to allow application to error gracefully when selected file might crash the application (should've been included in 1.0.0.0)
-Fix to allow multiple line breaks by either a tilde character or a full/partial carriage return (other returns currently not supported)
-And finally, this new box to inform you of this and other changes as they come!
-------------------------
Version 1.0.0.0
-Initial release, was overwritten initially after images were revised to load correctly as resources
